Real strong AI, real nature language comprehension

This is a project for REAL natural language comprehension. It is not based on machine learning, which cannot really comprehend natural language.

The basic mechanism is word explanation. Everything in our world is made up with basic elements, so are words, or more accurately, meanings. Words stand for meanings, which are basic elements of our world, and similar among different languages, as human share common concepts to comprehend the world.

I will find the very basic concepts or meanings, and words which mark them, maybe say 100 words, so that all the other words can be explained by the basic words (when you cannot explain it using more basic words, it will be a basic word). Then I will define how all the basic words relate and interact. Finally, we can know how all the words interact. Words are just marks, it is how they interact which define their meaings. The process is like the construction of maths, physics and all the other sciences. Actually any science should use this same way to build, but unfortunately machine learning is making NLP on another wrong way. We should calmly introspect the nature or essence of natural language, and not fit the superfacial data. ML, which is based on maths, is not the silver bullet. Phylosophy, Linguistics make up the core of NLP.

After the computers comprehend words, grammars and common rules, they can read books and the internet so as to get any knowledge. They can talk to human beings, so daily assist, auto-programming, psychological counseling and so on can be done by them.

This kind of AI is quite safe, as every word and every rule is defined by human beings, we can take full control of it.

Much work of this project are defining common rules, which is quite obvious but not recorded in books or the internet. For example, apples are round. The project will provide easy interface for people to input common rules, and this may become a new job.

Hopefully this project will automate the process of any job after the rules are defined, so as to simplify people's work. People just define rules, supervise and deal with exceptions. It provides auxiliary to people, not to replace people.

Within a specific field, the language is limited. So first application should be focus on a paticular field. Please comment on any ideas for application and I will cooperate with field experts to become something big.
